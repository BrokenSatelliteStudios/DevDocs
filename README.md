# DevDocs
Documentation and resources related to the development of our game.

This is a set of references compiled to aid in developing and deploying to the Unreal Engine. It is not intended to serve as
a tutorial. It was developed as a way for our team at Broken Satellite Studios, to communicate methods in work, and provide
documentations for said methods so that they may serve as reference later on. These documents are public and by using them you 
hereby agree to the terms and services listed below. Note that these documents are not intended to provide any unique, or 
otherwis proprietary methods, but rather a basic reference to known methods and solutions all compiled under one documentation. That being said
That being said, if any methods presented here are in fact proprietary, they will be stamped with a proprietary marker to be 
found on their documenation page and any use of them for commercial purposes will submit you to the terms of services below.

                                          
                                          
                                          ---- Terms and Servies ----- 

By using any of the proprietary methods listed in this document I hereby agree to pay reference to the development studio 
hosting said documents and give credit in any future works which utilize them. If the methods which you use are non-proprietary
or are not for commercial purposes, then you are not required to adhere to these terms.
